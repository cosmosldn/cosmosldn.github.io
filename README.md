## Development

We are using the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow) approach.

- `master` is the stable and live release
- `develop` is the latest always ahead of the master with all new features and bug fix
- `hotfix|feature` branches for each bug fix or feature

### Workflow

- Create new branch from `develop`
- Send a pull request back to `develop`
- Sit and wait üç∫
